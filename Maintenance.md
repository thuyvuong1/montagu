We need to keep Montagu up to date, even when there is no active development.

In particular, we need to make sure that we keep up to date with security issues. All members of the development team
should monitor all relevant security channels. If all members of the dev team are going to be away simultaneously, another 
member of staff should monitor them and contact a designated member of the dev team if there are any critical security 
announcements.
